# Neuromatch_summer_project_2021
Group project during [Neuromatch Academy](https://academy.neuromatch.io/) Computational Neuroscience Course (July 2021)

**Group members**: Jimmy Pulido Arias, Joseph Gonzalez, Lourdes Baztan Bitopoulos, May Xia, Mark Zarutin

Our group analyzed the Steinmetz dataset (2019) where mice earned water rewards by rotating a wheel 
to indicate which of two visual cues had higher contrast, or leaving it in place if no cue was presented. 
Our goal was to examine patterns of neural activity before and during wheel rotation and explore methods 
to predict the wheel rotating velocity (WRV) from neural activity.
